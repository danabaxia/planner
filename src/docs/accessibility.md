# Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview
Our Motion-Inspired Design System is built with accessibility as a core principle. We follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines and ensure our components are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or preferences.

## Core Features

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are focusable and have visible focus indicators
- Logical tab order follows document flow
- Focus trapping in modals and dialogs
- Skip links for main content navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts are documented and can be disabled

### Screen Reader Support
- Proper ARIA attributes and roles
- Descriptive labels and announcements
- Status updates using aria-live regions
- Hidden helper text for complex interactions
- Alternative text for icons and images

### Motion and Animations
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion system setting
- Essential animations preserved with reduced complexity
- Non-essential animations disabled when reduced motion is preferred
- No animations that could trigger vestibular disorders
- Safe animation values for opacity and transform properties

### Color and Contrast
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color contrast ratios
- Color is not the only means of conveying information
- High contrast mode support
- Customizable theme options
- Clear visual boundaries between elements

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Modal
- Traps focus within the modal when open
- Returns focus to trigger element when closed
- Clear close button with aria-label
- Proper role="dialog" and aria-modal="true"
- Descriptive title and optional description
- Escape key closes the modal
- Click outside to close (optional)
- Prevents background content interaction

### Forms
- Labels are properly associated with inputs
- Error messages are linked using aria-describedby
- Required fields are clearly indicated
- Input validation feedback is announced
- Clear success/error states
- Grouped inputs use fieldset and legend

### Navigation
- Current page/section is indicated
- Breadcrumbs show hierarchy
- Skip links for keyboard users
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Clear indication of external links

### Buttons and Links
- Clear focus states
- Descriptive text or aria-label
- Proper use of button vs link elements
- Loading states are announced
- Disabled states are properly handled

## Testing Guidelines

### Automated Testing
- Run axe-core for automated accessibility checks
- Test with ESLint a11y plugin
- Check color contrast ratios
- Validate HTML structure
- Monitor accessibility score

### Manual Testing
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS)
- Verify keyboard navigation
- Check focus management
- Test with different zoom levels
- Verify reduced motion support

### User Testing
- Include users with disabilities in testing
- Test with various assistive technologies
- Gather feedback on usability
- Address reported issues promptly
- Regular accessibility audits

## Best Practices

### Development
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper heading hierarchy
- Ensure proper focus management
- Add appropriate ARIA attributes
- Test with keyboard only

### Content
- Write clear, concise text
- Use proper heading structure
- Provide text alternatives
- Use descriptive link text
- Avoid directional language

### Design
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Design with keyboard users in mind
- Consider screen reader flow
- Plan for different viewport sizes
- Include focus indicators
