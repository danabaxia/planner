# Prettier Formatting Standard

When generating or editing code:

• Use Unix-style line endings (`LF`), no carriage returns (`␍`).
• Trim all trailing whitespace.
• Ensure one trailing newline at the end of the file.
• Use 2 spaces for indentation.
• Use semicolons at the end of statements.
• Use single quotes for strings.
• Add trailing commas for multiline object/array literals (`es5`).
• Do not add unused variables or imports.
• Ensure the code complies with `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc` settings in the project.

Always format code as if Prettier and ESLint will auto-check it.
