# Planner Application Database Utility Functions PRD

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing database utility functions for a planner application using Prisma and PostgreSQL. The functions will provide a clean, type-safe interface for database operations across all models.

## Core Requirements

### Database Setup
- PostgreSQL 17 database named 'planner_db'
- Prisma as the ORM layer
- Type-safe database operations
- Proper error handling and connection management

### Data Models
1. User Model
   - Basic user information (id, email, name)
   - Relationships to projects and tasks
   - Authentication-related fields

2. Project Model
   - Project metadata (id, name, description)
   - User relationships (owner, collaborators)
   - Task organization

3. Task Model
   - Task details (id, title, description, status)
   - Project association
   - User assignments
   - Due dates and priorities

4. Comment Model
   - Comment content
   - Task association
   - Author information
   - Timestamps

5. Attachment Model
   - File metadata
   - Task association
   - Upload information

### Required Database Operations

1. User Operations
   - Create new users
   - Update user information
   - Delete users
   - Find users by various criteria
   - Manage user relationships with projects

2. Project Operations
   - Create new projects
   - Update project details
   - Delete projects
   - Find projects by criteria
   - Manage project memberships

3. Task Operations
   - Create tasks
   - Update task status and details
   - Delete tasks
   - Find tasks by various filters
   - Manage task assignments

4. Comment Operations
   - Add comments to tasks
   - Update comment content
   - Delete comments
   - Retrieve comments for tasks

5. Attachment Operations
   - Add attachments to tasks
   - Remove attachments
   - Update attachment metadata
   - Retrieve attachments

### Technical Requirements

1. Type Safety
   - Full TypeScript support
   - Prisma-generated types
   - Custom type definitions where needed
   - Type inference for query results

2. Error Handling
   - Graceful error handling
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Transaction support where needed
   - Connection error recovery

3. Performance
   - Efficient query patterns
   - Connection pooling
   - Proper indexing
   - Query optimization

4. Code Organization
   - Modular function design
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Database Client
   - Singleton Prisma client instance
   - Proper connection management
   - Environment-based configuration

2. Utility Functions
   - Consistent function signatures
   - Promise-based async operations
   - Input validation
   - Result type definitions

3. Testing Requirements
   - Unit tests for all functions
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Test database configuration
   - Mock data generation

4. Documentation
   - Function documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Type definitions
   - Error handling guidelines

## Success Criteria
1. All database operations are type-safe
2. Functions handle errors gracefully
3. Operations follow Prisma best practices
4. Code passes all TypeScript checks
5. Tests cover core functionality
6. Documentation is complete and accurate

## Future Considerations
1. Caching layer integration
2. Soft delete implementation
3. Audit logging
4. Schema versioning
5. Performance monitoring
